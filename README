  tele_doll_catcher

  Catch a doll in a doll-catching machine with your left hand
  rather than a traditional joystick. You'll need an Arduino to
  run this package.Based on Garratt(from MIT)'s skeletal_tracker.

  This repo is actually a demo using kinect and arduino in ROS. You'll need a kinect, a computer that runs ROS Electric (tested with Ubuntu 11.10), and an arduino board(except UNO, see below) for this. A doll catcher machine would be nice, but without one is fine.  Merge the directory "sketchbook" to your arduino sketch book directory, and upload "doll_catcher_positive_message.pde" (or.ino if you use Arduino IDE 1.0) to your arduino board. Remember to wire arduino up according to the source file, you can use 5 LEDs to replace the relays.
  
  To run this package, connect everything to your computer, type "roslaunch tele_coll_catcher doll_catcher.launch", surrender to kinect for calibration, then you're good to go!
